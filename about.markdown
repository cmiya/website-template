# Teaching Philosophy

## Participatory Learning Through Research-Creation

In my pedagogy, I explore ways for students to learn about and engage with technologies of literature, including through hands-on research creation projects. Students of my Undergraduate English Case Studies in Research class have in the past created poetry chapbooks and interactive digital poems using the open-source software Twine. For my Upper-Level Undergraduate Digital Cultures class, I designed a dataveillance project, in which students applied the critical data skills and concepts learned in class to carry out and creatively respond to a self-surveillance data study.

In addition to teaching courses in McMaster's Communication and Media Studies Department, I teach workshops in the Sherman Centre for Digital Schoalrship on topics like Intro to Podcasting, Version Control with Git, and Building Minimal Sites with Jekyll.
