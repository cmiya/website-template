I am a Postdoctoral Fellow with the [Sherman Centre for Digital Scholarship](https://scds.ca/) at McMaster University. My research and teaching interests include critical code studies, nineteenth-century American literature, and the digital humanities. I am a Research Affiliate of the SpokenWeb Network, and I have held research positions with the Kule Institute for Advanced Study (KIAS) and the Canadian Writing Research Collaboratory (CWRC). I co-edited the anthology *Right Research: Modelling Sustainable Research Practices in the Anthropocene* (Open Book Publishers 2021), and my article “Student-Driven Digital Learning: A Call to Action” appeared in People, Practice, Power: Digital Humanities Outside the Center (MIT Press 2021).

I am also a podcast creator! You can listen to my episodes "Sounds of Data," "Academics on Air," and "Drum Codes" on [The SpokenWeb Podcast](https://spokenweb.ca/podcast/spokenweb-podcast/).
