I am a Postdoctoral Fellow with the [Sherman Centre for Digital Scholarship](https://scds.ca/) at McMaster University. My research and teaching interests include critical code studies, nineteenth-century American literature, and the digital humanities. I am a past Postdoctoral Fellow and current Research Affiliate of the [SpokenWeb at the University of Alberta. I have also held research positions with the Kule Institute for Advanced Study (KIAS) and the Canadian Writing Research Collaboratory (CWRC). I co-edited the anthology Right Research: Modelling Sustainable Research Practices in the Anthropocene (Open Book Publishers 2021), and my article “Student-Driven Digital Learning: A Call to Action” appeared in People, Practice, Power: Digital Humanities Outside the Center (MIT Press 2021).

I have recently discovered a knack for scholarly podcasting. You can listen to my work on [The SpokenWeb Podcast](https://spokenweb.ca/podcast/spokenweb-podcast/) in the episodes "Sounds of Data," "Academics on Air," and "Drum Codes."
